# A program with a reasonably deep error to test error handling and traceback abilities.
# at the time of writing, the error handler should give a line number but nothing else.

# create a list {0, 1, 2, 3, [], 5}
0[](1[])(2[])(3[])(4[])([][])(5[])

# multiply each element by 2
[
    ()(())
)
# add 1 to each element
[
    ()(1)
)
# exit
